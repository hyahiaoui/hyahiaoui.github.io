# Hello, World!

Hi folks,

this one is (yet another) attempt at having a blog, a personal projects portfolio and a site to host my notes and ideas.

This time, I had fun setting it up using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), and a pinch of older tools (`make`).

Let's see how long it lives and where it leads us.
